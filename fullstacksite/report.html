        <ul>
            <li>A for HTML</li>
                <p>We generated HTML with React</p>
            <li>A for CSS</li>
                <p>We generated CSS with React, and made
                CSS modules stylesheet for each page.
                <ul><li>
                    Issue with CSS and React:
                    Font-awesome and material-ui icons behaved
                    differently for style tags, solution was to
                    make different functions that styled font-awesome
                    icons with a div tag.
                </ul></li></p>
            <li>A for JS</li>
                <p>We have investigated eventListeners, eventHandlers,
                    and browser routers with client-side JS framework, 
                    React. We also created animation with CSS.
                </p>
            <li>A for PNG</li>
                <p>All images in the assets folder were taken from
                    the Tangerine Rye facebook page. Images had to be
                    manually edited using Photoshop to create transparent
                    backgrounds. Album covers were also edited by cloning
                    the background pattern and stamping to remove the 
                    tangerine rye logo.
                </p>
            <li>X for SVG</li>
                <p>We have not explored creating vector graphics, but
                    all icons taken from font-awesome and material-ui
                    were SVG.
                    <ul><li>
                        Does this count towards SVG or do we need to
                        make original SVG?
                    </li></ul>
                </p>
            <li>B for Server</li>
                <p>We have not handled https and certificates, but we
                    have handled port numbers and integrating with client
                    with an /api/subs to handle post requests.
                    <ul><li>
                        We are going to try to deploy to Heroku
                        for cloud hosting.
                    </li></ul>
                </p>
            <li>B for Database</li>
                <p>We have managed to insert data and extract it in
                    localhost:3001/api/subs, by using async/await style.
                    <ul><li>
                        Future work: we are trying to implement
                        a transaction system in which the DB schema
                        will be extensive. This will also count
                        towards the dynamic pages.
                    </li></ul>
                </p>
            <li>X for Dynamic pages</li>
                <p>We have not created dynamic pages.</p>
            <li>X for Depth (out of 20)</li>
        </ul>
