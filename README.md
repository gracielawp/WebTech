# Tangerine Rye Prototype Website

This website was submitted as coursework for the Web Technologies module at University of Bristol. Our website is built for a dear friend's band Tangerine Rye, with a merchandise store incorporated in the website. As per the instructions, we only used Javascript to build both the front-end and back-end of the website. **React** framework was chosen for the front-end development and **Sqlite3** was used to handle database access.
