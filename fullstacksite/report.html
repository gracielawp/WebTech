        <p>This website was made for a dear friend's band, Tangerine Rye.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A for HTML</b></li>
                <p>We generated HTML with React. We chose React as we
                   wanted to learn the industry standard.
                </p>
            <li><b>A for CSS</b></li>
                <p>We generated CSS with React, and made
                CSS modules stylesheet for each page. We also designed
                responsive pages that resize on smaller screens.
                The gradient animated background was also made with CSS.
                We also investigated several issues with CSS and React:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Font-awesome and material-ui icons behaved
                    differently for style tags, solution was to
                    make different functions that styled font-awesome
                    icons with a div tag.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
            <li><b>A for JS</b></li>
                <p>We have investigated eventListeners, eventHandlers,
                    and browser routers with client-side JS framework, 
                    React. We also created animation with CSS.
                </p>
            <li><b>A for PNG</b></li>
                <p>All images in the assets folder were taken from
                    the Tangerine Rye facebook page. Images had to be
                    manually edited using Photoshop to create transparent
                    backgrounds.
                    <br>
                    <span class="img-center" style="background-color: aqua;">
                        <b>BEFORE</b>
                    <img 
                        src="client/src/assets/tangerinerye_logo_before.png" 
                        alt="Tangerine Rye logo before manipulation"

                        height="150" />
                        <b>AFTER</b>
                    </span>
                    Album covers were also edited by cloning
                    the background pattern and stamping to remove the 
                    Tangerine Rye logo.

            <li><b>A for SVG</b></li>
                <p>All icons taken from font-awesome and material-ui
                    were SVG. As all the band logos were professionally 
                    made, there was no real use for homemade SVG 
                    designs. For the purpose of this assignment,
                    we created a cat SVG logo with Inkscape (because one of the 
                    contributors has 5 cats at home and is obsessed
                    with cats!) and pasted it onto a t-shirt and a cap 
                    as fake merchandise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The original cat logo and its merchandise:</b>
                </p>
                <span class="img-center">
                <img 
                    src="client/src/assets/catLogo.svg" 
                    alt="cat svg logo"
                    width="300" />
                <br>
                <img 
                    src="client/src/assets/cat_whitetshirtfront.png" 
                    alt="cat logo on white t-shirt"
                    width="300"/>
                <img 
                    src="client/src/assets/cat_capfront.png" 
                    alt="cat logo on red cap"
                    width="300"/>
                </span>
                <p>The cat logo was created using a combination of freehand drawings
                    (to draw the whiskers), path transformations (cylinders into cat eyes;
                    triangles to curve creating cat ears), as well as grouping and 
                    duplicating objects to flip horizontally to create a symmetrical logo
                    (this was done by dragging a guideline down the center to only create
                    half the image first before duplicating object to create mirror image).
                    Photoshop was used to paste logo onto t-shirt and cap mockups (PNG).
                </p>
            <li><b>A for Server</b></li>
                <p>We have self-issued our own self-signed SSL certificate
                    and keys, but as we have not gotten a domain name, we could
                    not get a valid authorised certificate.
                    We also have handled port numbers and integrating with client
                    with an /api route to handle get/post requests.
                    We also handled URL parameter validation in /api/products/:productId
                    by checking that productId is always an integer through regex. 
                    The server also handles 404 and 500 errors.
                </p>
            <li><b>A for Database</b></li>
                <p>
                    We have managed to insert data and extract it in
                    localhost:3001/api/subs, by using async/await style. We have
                    designed a database schema to store email subscriptions, products
                    (name, description, pictures, price) and customers (address, name,
                    ordered products). To our knowledge, this schema is normalised up to
                    BCNF.
                </p>
            <li><b>A for Dynamic pages</b></li>
                <p>We have not created dynamic pages.</p>
