# WebTech

This is the coursework of the Web Technologies module at University of Bristol. Our website is built for a dear friend's band Tangerine Rye. As per the instructions, we used node server to host the website. **React** framework was chosen for frontend development and **Sqlite3** is for backend database queries.

### Install node modules

``` npm install```

### Start the website on localhost

```npm run dev```

### Website on Heroku

```https://tangerinerye.herokuapp.com/``` Note that heroku does not support **Sqlite3** thus some pages displays "loading..." only.
