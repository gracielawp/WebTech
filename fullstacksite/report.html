        </h3>
        <p>This website was made for a dear friend's band, Tangerine Rye.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>A for HTML</b></li>
            <p>
                We generated HTML with React framework. We chose React as we
                wanted to learn the industry standard.
                We used divisions very well, combining with css styling and React JSX ES6 style.
            </p>
            <li><b>A for CSS</b></li>
            <p>
                We generated CSS with React, and made CSS module 
                stylesheets for each page. We also designed
                responsive pages that resizes components 
                on mobile screens with @media. This included changing 
                the flex-direction from row to column, and various 
                different min-width sizes found through trial and error.
                The animated gradient background was also made with CSS.
                Although the spinning vinyl-record on the music page was not made by us 
                (taken from <a href="https://codepen.io/thebabydino/pen/HjJlL">
                codepen</a>), the CSS to contain the album and single EP
                covers on the vinyl record was made by us. It was difficult 
                to get the pictures to align in a triangle symmetrically, so 
                the alignment is not perfect. Our initial idea for the record 
                containing album stickers were to have them play the music when 
                clicked. However, spotify/youtube can only have embed code through 
                iframe. We did not want to have the full music just play on the 
                website as this meant there will be no royalties received from 
                playing. Hence, we just placed the spotify and youtube iframe below 
                the record. There are still hover animations associated with the 
                stickers but no associated clickEvents are programmed. We also made 
                sure that there are no style tags in the code, but all CSS styling 
                is done by div className tags.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also investigated several issues with CSS and React:
            <ul>
                <li>
                Font-awesome and material-ui icons behaved
                differently for style tags, so our solution was to
                make different functions that styled font-awesome
                icons with a div tag. This can be seen in 
                client/src/views/IconBar.js, as well as using "withStyles"
                method (see client/src/views/ButtonStyle.js) to modify their styles.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li><b>A for JS</b></li>
            <p>We have investigated eventListeners, eventHandlers, stateHandlers
                and browser routers with client-side JS framework,
                React. We also created animation with CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                We spent efforts in keeping our code DRY, which means we have a number of child components
                that are called by parent components. We also learnt how to pass data and functions between parent and child
                components.
                <ul>
                <li>
                    The overhead logo and navigation bar, as well as the footer are components that
                    are called by every page.
                    On the selected page, the responding tab will display differently. This is achieved by passing down
                    property (props) from the page to the OverHeadBar.js component:
                    <img class="img-center" src="client/src/assets/headbarActive.png"/>
                </li>
                <li>
                    TOUR, SHOP, and CART pages fetch data from database then render each item as a
                    child component. This is done by mapping the json arrays:
                    <P>
                        client/src/views/ShoppingCartPage.js
                        <img class="img-center" src="client/src/assets/JsMappingCode.png" />
                    </P>
            <p>
                The above code snippet shows how we rendered the products in our shopping cart page.
                After fetching the products in the shopping cart from the local storage, we map them one by one and render them in
                the child class "CartProduct". We also pass 3 functions from the parent to the child
                (onRemove, updateCart and zeroCount) as props, so that we can update the parent from the child
                by calling back.
            </p>
            <p>
                client/src/Component/CartProduct.js
                <img class="img-center" src="client/src/assets/childCallback.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
                This is also used on updating the same page. In product's detail page, there are products that
                have multiple pictures, they are rendered as small images on the left and user can click on them
                to render them on the right with a bigger size. On cat Cap detail page, the bigger image on the right is rendered by clicking its small image
                on the left, while the url stays unchanged:
                <img class="img-center" src="client/src/assets/hat2Pic.png" />
            </p>
            <p>
                One important thing we learnt from rendering child classes by mapping is that we need to provide
                a unique key to React. This key cannot only be unique within the loop, i.e. key={index}. Because
                in this way, if we update the array and removed the first object, the previous second object will
                take over the first place, thus it will also take over the old child state of when key={0}.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example: if we have product A with attribute "count"=2 and product B with attribute "count"=1.
                They will be rendered one by one by calling the child component in the mapping loop.
                So React will know them as key={0} (for product A) and key={1}
                (for product B). So in the child states, product A will have this.state.count=2, while product B's is 1.
                This is correct.
                Now if we click the button in the child component to remove product A from the array in the parent component,
                then re-render the child component
                by mapping, the index for product B will become 0, thus key={0} for product B, as opposed to its
                previous key={1}. Then React will give B
                the state that was assigned to key={0}, which belonged to product A, and displays this.state.count=2, instead of 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                This shows how important the key attribute is in mapping child component. It has to associate with an
                unique property within the object, rather than a random looping index.
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                We used async functions when fetching data from the database.
                <p>
                    client/src/views/MerchPage.js
                    <img class="img-center" src="client/src/assets/async.png" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    This allows us to load the data and tell the user we are still loading,
                    then render the page after loading is completed.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                We have a thorough understanding of the different type of functions: the one with arrow and the
                one without. When calling a function from within the JSX component call, it is important to call
                it with arrow format, otherwise it will be called every time that piece of code is reached (if this
                piece of code is in render function, it will lead to an infinite loop/call).
            </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <li><b>A for PNG</b></li>
                <p>All images in the assets folder were taken from
                    the Tangerine Rye facebook page. Images had to be
                    manually edited using Photoshop to create transparent
                    backgrounds. This was done by first cropping and magic wand 
                    to select the white background and deleting it. However, the wand 
                    could not select all of the white background, so manual selection 
                    was done to get all the white background removed. Similar 
                    manipulations were done on the blue album cover. The shadow 
                    was removed completely to make the transparent cover cleaner. 
                    The manipulations on the album cover was undoubtedly harder, 
                    as the black tire and the dark blue background did not contrast 
                    as much as the logo (orange and white).

                    Album covers were also edited by cloning

                Additionally, to create our own merchandise from our homemade SVG logo, we 
                used Photoshop to manipulate the logo onto t-shirt and cap mock-ups. To 
                create the illusion of the logo being on the merchandise, the logo layer 
                was set to multiply and opacity was slightly decreased to mimic the t-shirt 
                creases and the cap texture. The t-shirt and cap mock-ups were found online.
                </p>
            <li><b>A for SVG</b></li>
                <p>All icons taken from font-awesome and material-ui
                    were SVG. As all the band logos were professionally
                    made, there was no real use for homemade SVG
                    designs. For the purpose of this assignment,
                    we created a cat SVG logo with Inkscape (because one of the
                    contributors has 5 cats at home and is obsessed
                    with cats!) and pasted it onto a t-shirt and a cap
                    as fake merchandise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The original cat logo and its merchandise:</b>
                </p>
                <span class="img-center">
                <img

                </span>
                <p>The cat logo was created using a combination of freehand drawings
                    (to draw the whiskers), path transformations (cylinders into cat eyes;
                    triangles to curve creating cat ears), as well as grouping and
                    duplicating objects to flip horizontally to create a symmetrical logo
                    (this was done by dragging a guideline down the center to only create
                    half the image first before duplicating object to create mirror image).
                    Photoshop was used to paste logo onto t-shirt and cap mockups (PNG).

            <li><b>A for Server</b></li>
                <p>For our server, we chose to use Express to make routing easier. 
                    We have handled port numbers in both development and production. This 
                    included having a separate http port for production (Heroku has an 
                    automatic SSL certificate) and a https port in localhost. 
                    The server has a REST API with an /api route to handle get/post requests.
                    From the /api route, we created /orders, /products, /subs, /tour routes.
                    To prevent SQL injections, all INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT WHERE statements were 
                    prepared statements (by using ? to insert the value/parameter). Each route 
                    was created to handle different get/post requests. For example, api/subs 
                    handles post requests from the client-side to insert a new subscriber email. 
                    The route also displays all the current data in subscribers. Different 
                    routes were also created for api/orders to handle post requests from 
                    a successful transaction. The route api/orders/createNewOrder takes all 
                    the json data from the req.body and inserts it into the relevant tables. 
                    As there are optional values in customers and addresses, the values are 
                    only inserted if the json object for it is not null through UPDATE. 
                    In the route api/products, there is another route to get each individual 
                    product data and pictures. This is shown as api/products/:productId.
                    We handled URL parameter validation in /api/products/:productId
                    by checking that productId is always an integer via regex. The reason 
                    why we made different routes for data of all products and individual 
                    product is because the merch page first needs to get all the products, 
                    but only needs one picture associated with it. If we just did a SELECT *
                    query and a INNER JOIN, the json data sent would have multiple identical 
                    product ids with different pictures (if the product has more than one 
                    picture, like a front and back view). Hence, the api/products was limited 
                    to the first picture only, and more pictures can be fetched from its /:productId. 
                    This was used in the detailPage to display the merchandise details. 
                    The server also handles 404 and 500 errors, and redirects to https.
                </p>
                <P>As we wanted to try deploying the web application online, we chose
                    Heroku as our cloud hosting platform due to its ease. This can be found
                    on <b><a href='https://tangerinerye.herokuapp.com/'>this link</a></b>. 
                    However, we found out that it does not support sqlite3 as a database, and
                    will require the database to be rebuilt, for instance, in postgresql. 
                    Hence, only static assets are served and any dynamic pages are only shown 
                    as loading... 
                    We have also self-issued our own self-signed SSL certificate
                    and keys using openssl, but did not get an authorised certificate. The initial plan was 
                    to deploy to a cloud server to get a domain and request one from 
                    <a href="https://letsencrypt.org">letsencrypt.org</a>, however,
                    because the app is unfinished (we have not dealt with transactions, and
                    the deployed application is only static), we did not have time to get one. 
                    Additionally, having a separate SSL certificate on Heroku required money.
                </P>
            <li><b>A for Database</b></li>
                <p>The database schema is in the folder /db/dbSchema.js which is used in 
                    /db/createdb.js to create the database, data.db. The database is then 
                    accessed via a REST API.
                    <span class="img-center">
                    <img 
                        src="schema.png"
                        alt="database schema" />
                    </span>
                    The website allows anyone to join the mailing list by just submitting
                    their email into the form, which will be stored in the table Subscribers.
                    The email address is stored as TEXT and has an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY 
                    subs_id, which auto-increments when new data is inserted. The tour page 
                    is also rendered dynamically by getting data from the database, and the 
                    relevant data is stored in Tour_Dates. All fields are NOT NULL.
                    The merch page is also rendered dynamically on the client-side, and 
                    the data is fetched from the Products table. To allow the client-side 
                    to render the relevant pictures, Product_Pics includes a field picture 
                    TEXT which is the name of the product picture stored in /assets. The 
                    product can have none or many pictures associated with it.
                </p>
                <p>To store transaction data, Customers, Addresses, Order_Items, Cust_Orders
                    tables are used. We want the customer to be able to shop without having 
                    to log in, hence each customer that has already paid will be stored as 
                    a new customer even if they have already purchased from the site before.
                    This is implemented this way as names or email are not treated as UNIQUE
                    attributes. Similarly, the Addresses table associated with the customer 
                    through the associative entity Cust_Addr will store new addresses for 
                    each customer. There are optional fields in Customers and Addresses, 
                    namely cust_phone, addr_line_2 and addr_line_3, which do not have 
                    NOT NULL attributes. As we have not implemented a real transaction feature
                    through PayPal sandbox, no billing addresses are stored (assumes that 
                    home address is the same as the billing address). A customer can order 1 
                    or more products of any quantity, and this is stored in Order_Items and 
                    Cust_Orders.
                </p>
                <p>The schema complies with 1NF as each attribute has atomic values, and each 
                    value is a single element. It also satisfies 2NF sa there are no partial
                    functional dependencies, as the primary keys for each table are unique. 
                    However, Order_Items does not satisfy 3NF, as there is a transitive dependency 
                    between quantity->product_id->order_id->id. However, although this violates 
                    3NF, it makes it easier for the API to get the quantities of the associated 
                    product order. 
                </p>
            <li><b>A for Dynamic pages</b></li>
                <p>
                    We have created dynamic pages for individual product detail page. It gets rendered by user
                    clicking the "DETAILS" button in the shopping page and will take the id of the product
                    and direct to /merch/:id.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The dynamic page is not simply called by the shopping page (/merch). The product details
                    are passed from MerchPage.js to its child component Product.js, which is rendered by mapping
                    each entry of the JSON array as mentioned in JS section above. Then in Product.js the id of
                    the product is passed to ClickDetail Button in ClickButton.js, which takes it as a path for the
                    url. Then, because this url matches the pattern declared in AllPath.js (/merch/:id), the DetailPage.js gets
                    rendered. In the meantime, that id is stored to in props.match.params as a property to the page.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in DetailPage.js, it fetches the id of the specific product to render from
                    this.props.match.params.id. After this async function finished, the details of this product gets
                    loaded.
